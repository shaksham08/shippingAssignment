# Shipping Expense Calculator

This web app helps logistics teams track shipping boxes, storing receiver details, weight, destination, and a color-coded identifier. The UI is built with React and styled with Tailwind, with Vite powering the development environment.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- npm 9 or later (bundled with recent Node.js releases)

You can confirm your versions with:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Install Dependencies

From the project root, install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run the App in Development

Start the Vite dev server (defaults to `http://localhost:5173`):

```bash
npm run dev
```

The terminal output shows the local and network URLs. The server supports hot module replacement, so UI changes appear immediately.

## Build for Production

Create an optimized build inside the `dist` directory:

```bash
npm run build
```
